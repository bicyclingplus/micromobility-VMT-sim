# Who
This is a project being led by Dillon Fitch, a researcher of traffic technology and design at UC Davis.

# Goal
Dillon studies whether micromobility changes the way that people get around. Does it reduce their driving?

# Data
Dillon is planning a survey. His planned design is hierarchical: select cities, then micromobility users in those cities, then follow each user for a while to get data on their driving behavior and their micromobility use. Plans for two cohorts: one is all registered users of a micromobility service, and the other is a set of users who are both new and regular micromobility users.

These will be paired with another cohort in each city, demographically matched but not micromobility users.

Each cohort in each city should have 200+ subjects.

# Analysis
A linear mixed-effect model is the first choice here.
